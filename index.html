        <p><strong>Hey there üëã!</strong></p>
        <p>
          I'm a seasoned software engineer in sunny Portland, Oregon who skews
          heavily towards the front-end and enjoys UI and UX development.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've spent time in all sorts of industries - FinTech Startups, Digital
          Agencies, Nationally-recognized Brands, and even Government/Defense
          work.
        </p>
        <p>
          While I am a self-starter, I love working in highly-collaborative
          environments, and I will <em>always</em> be a strong advocate for the
          end user.
        </p>

            <h3>Flow Finance (2021 - 2023)</h3>
            <h4 class="gradient-text">
              Senior <span>‚û°Ô∏è</span> Lead UI/X Engineer
            </h4>
            <p>
              At Flow, I was charged with building the user interfaces for all
              of our applications, managing our design system, consulting with
              our Product Owner to derive requirements, and generally lend my UX
              expertise and instincts to anybody who needed it.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a nice bonus, I had the privilege of mentoring our Junior
              engineers.

            <h4 class="gradient-text">Software Engineer</h4>
            <p>
              I was brought on to help shepherd sunsetting a legacy Angular
              application for the Line Planning Management division, then we
              built a series of MVP applications with React & Redux to replace
              it.

            <h4 class="gradient-text">Senior UI/UX Developer</h4>
            <p>
              Live Axle was a digital agency, and as such, I was responsible for
              crafting solutions for our clientele in both the TV/Film/News, and
              hardware manufacturing industries.

            <h4 class="gradient-text">Web Developer &amp; UI/X Designer</h4>
            <p>
              Here, I was primarily in charge of designing an invoicing
              application and lending expertise to a team of ASP.NET developers
              who needed someone who could build interfaces outside of their
              chosen framework.

            </h4>
            <p>
              I began as a lead on our multimedia team, where my largest
              achievement was creating a 30-minute documentary series in Flash,
              then I transitioned to being a web developer for the US Army's
              custom CMS, CORE.

            <p>
              Here I had to be a true jack-of-all-trades. I supported DARPA (you
              may make a Metal Gear Solid joke here if you wish) in the
              following ways:
